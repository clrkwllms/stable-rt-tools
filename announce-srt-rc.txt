Dear RT Folks,

This is the RT stable review cycle of patch {new_version}.

Please scream at me if I messed something up. Please test the patches
too.

The -rc release will be uploaded to kernel.org and will be deleted
when the final release is out. This is just a review release (or
release candidate).

The pre-releases will not be pushed to the git repository, only the
final release is.

If all goes well, this patch will be converted to the next main
release on {release_date}.

Enjoy,

-- Daniel
